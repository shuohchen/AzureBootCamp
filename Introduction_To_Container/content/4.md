# Bonus Exercise: Create an Azure Container Instance

## Overview

In this **BONUS** exercise, you will learn how to deploy an image from Azure Container Registry to run in a container as an Azure Container Instance.

Note: this deployment can take 15-20 minutes to complete.

# Task 1: Run an instance

1. In the previous exercise, you ended looking at the registries and tags in your container registry. Open this page if you navigated away.

2. Right-click on the __latest__ tag name for your *contoso/ads-service* repository, and then select __Run instance__.
